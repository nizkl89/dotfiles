# macOS Dotfiles

Welcome to my macOS dotfiles repository! This is a curated collection of configurations for a clean, minimal, and efficient macOS environment tailored to my workflow.

## Overview

These dotfiles bring the streamlined, productive setup I enjoy on Arch Linux to macOS, focusing on simplicity and functionality. They primarily enhance **Tmux** and **Aerospace**, delivering a lightweight yet powerful experience for developers and power users.

This is a personal backup of my custom macOS setup, but feel free to explore or adapt it for your own use.

## Features

- **Minimalistic Design**: Prioritizes speed and simplicity, cutting out unnecessary complexity.
- **Tmux Configuration**: Customized for efficient terminal multiplexing and session management.
- **Aerospace Integration**: Replicates the tiling window management workflow from Arch Linux.
- **macOS-Specific Tweaks**: Optimized settings to boost productivity.
- **Terminal Tools**: Includes configurations for tools like `fd`, `fzf`, `zoxide`, and `eza`.
- **Tmux Plugins**: Uses TPM for plugin management, with the Catppuccin theme for a clean aesthetic.

## Notes

This setup is tailored to my preferences and requires manual installation of tools and dependencies (e.g., Tmux Plugin Manager, Catppuccin theme, and terminal tools). While it’s primarily for my personal use, you’re welcome to explore and adapt it to your needs.

No installation guide is provided—check the dotfiles for details on configurations.
